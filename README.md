# Eruptions in the Attention Economy  
**Tracking volcanic eruptions and public engagement through multilingual social media analysis**

## Overview  
This repository contains the code and data used in the research project *"Eruptions in the Attention Economy"*, which investigates how volcanic eruptions are perceived and discussed on social media across different languages. The project focuses on Twitter (𝕏) data and includes tools for data collection, multilingual analysis, and figure preparation for academic publication.

## Contents  
- `crawler.py`: Python script for collecting tweets using the Twitter API (𝕏 API), filtered by keyword and language.  
- `Eruptions-social-media_review.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for cleaning, analysing, and visualising tweet data.  
- Partially processed datasets in CSV format (tweet counts for different keywords/languages).
- `Figures/`: Directory containing Figures output by the Notebook.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eruptions-on-social-media.git
   cd eruptions-on-social-media
<!-- pip install -r requirements.txt -->

## Usage  

### 1. Crawling Tweets  
#### Please note that free use of the Twitter standard API has been discontinued as of March 2025.
Edit the `crawler.py` file to specify:
- API credentials (Twitter/𝕏 API keys)  
- Keywords  
- Languages  
- Time range  

Then run:  
```tcsh
python crawler.py
```

### 2. Analysing Data
Open the Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook Eruptions-social-media_review.ipynb
```

The notebook walks through:

Processing the CSV datasets

Time series analysis of keyword datasets

Statistical tests on keyword datasets

Generating figures for publication



---

## Data Availability  
The repository includes **partially processed CSV datasets**. Original raw data in JSON format (downloaded via the Twitter API) are excluded due to storage limits, but can be provided on request.
